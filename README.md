# Some project where I mess with Rust

I'm working through the Rust book in order to appreciate what bits of Swift are descended from it.

## Setup

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

Install rustup:

```bash
brew install rustup-init
rustup-init
```

Add rustup to your PATH as directed by the installer output.

Optionally [add shell completions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs#enable-tab-completion-for-bash-fish-zsh-or-powershell).

Open the Rust book:

```bash
rustup doc --book
```
